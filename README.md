Coursework for CS 230 Operating Systems Class

Summary: You work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a technology consultant. CTS has taken on a new client called "The Gaming Room". The Gaming Room currently currently hosts a game called "Draw It or Lose It" on the Android platform. They want to expand past the Android platform and tap a wider market. To do this they desire to create a web server.  The staff at The Gaming Room does not know how to set up a web server environment. To facilitate this task you need to help them streamline their development. This will involve a software design document that provides an Executive Summary, Design Constraints, Domain Model, Evaluation of various Server OS and IDEs of those OS, and Recommendations based upon all of this research. 

<b> What did you do particularly well in this documentation? </b>

I went the extra distance to research every avenue for the client and provide them options that will help their game excel. The client has been provided a detailed . Additionally I provided an eye to detail for scaling their application. This is exceedingly important, as a games momentum can shift due to technical difficulties or the inability to support multiple users. A fully informed client can make better decisions about the future of their company during and after our consultation. 

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>

It's very beneficial to have a design document on hand. The design document kept development from straying off the beaten path. It's very easy to get distracted by the various options that exist in the Computer Science sphere. 

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>

If I could change one thing it would be providing more resources and citations throughout my work. It was only partway through the course I realized I should be documenting the various tabs I was navigating to pull together a summary. There are so many routes of information on these program's functionalities that it's impossible to use only 1 or 2 sources. 

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>

The user's needs were considered heavily in utilizing the Singleton Design. By having only one instance of a GameService at any given time the risk of duplication was eliminated. The User's needs are one of the most important details of any given project. You can change the fulfillment, you can change your execution, but you will NEVER be able to change dissapointing or losing a client due to not listening and delivering on their expressed needs. Software is useless without users to utilize it. 

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>

In my personal experience (this course included), designing software is a series of steps. Firstly I will determine what I am designing and why I am designing it. Secondly I will go about drafting roughly how I think processes will communicate and decide upon the language. Thirdly I will gather resources I need to develop. Fourth I will begin developing the program and likely boomerang back and forth between steps three and four until completion.
